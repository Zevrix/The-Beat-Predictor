# The-Beat-Predictor

Program used to keep track of the songs playing on Vancouvers The Beat 94.5 while also collecting data about the songs from youtube.
Using the data I wrote an algorithm in order to determine the likelihood of any particular song being played. Accuracy is surprisingly good, I can generate a list of 7-10 songs I predict will be next and I am correct about 80% of the time.

UPDATE: The Beat 94.5 no longer exists. :(
